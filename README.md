Algorithms I Assignment 10 Group Project (Raven). 



## Data:  
routes.dat.txt  
planes.dat.txt  
  
routes_info.csv (column names for routes.dat.txt scrapped from assignment info page)  
planes_cap.csv (planes.dat.txt joined with capacity data scrapped from https://blog.thetravelinsider.info/airplane-types)  


## Goals
Consider trips between destinations that involve no more than 1 layover (i.e. trips involving a beginning and at most one intermediate stop before the destination).  Consider a source city, say New York, and a target city, say San Francisco.  Answer the following questions:   

1.	Given your inferred load on each flight, what is the maximal number of people that can be moved from New York to San Francisco?  
2.	Which carrier can transport the greatest number of individuals from New York to San Francisco?  

* You will have to make some decisions about how you count people and flights.  Carefully stating what decisions you are making is an important part of answering the questions.
  
  
  
## A complete solution should include 
*	a pdf describing how data was transformed, a description of what algorithms were used in the solution, how algorithms were implemented, how the solution was validated, and a discussion concerning how the work might be extended.  
*	Documented code for the problem.  
*	A 15-minute slide show presentation in which each team member presents part of the solution.  

## Evaluation Rubric:
There are four main components of the evaluation:
1.	Correctness: Does the implemented algorithm correctly solve the given problem?
2.	Report: Does the written description of the algorithm clearly describe what design choices were made, why such choices were made, how choices were implemented, how the algorithm was tested and how the algorithm might be varied in future work?
3.	Code: Is the code well-documented?  Is it extensible?
4.	Presentation: Does the presentation clearly describe the work that was done?  Can team members answer questions about the project?
